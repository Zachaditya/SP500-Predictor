# SP500-Predictor with Random Forest Classifier

This project aims to predict the movements of S&P 500 stock prices using a machine learning approach. A Random Forest Classifier model is employed to analyze historical stock market data and predict future price trends. The model evaluates various financial features, such as historical price data, trading volume, and technical indicators, to generate predictions. The system was evaluated using precision scores to measure its performance.
